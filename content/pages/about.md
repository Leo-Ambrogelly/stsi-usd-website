      Science and technology play a significant role in contemporary society by healing people, internationalizing connections, and expediting processes, often taking center stage in public policy. Therefore, it is imperative to have a comprehensive understanding of these topics. The mission of the STS-I is to advocate for the successful implementation of a Science, Technology, and Society (STS) program. Students who pursue the program will receive robust training in the sciences and technologies, coupled with a holistic understanding of these subjects within their full historical, social, and cultural contexts. Additionally, the initiative will survey how scientific and technological knowledge is advanced, taught, and contested on the political stage. This initiative aims to bridge intellectual gaps among students and faculty across various colleges, schools, and departments at USD that interact with the sciences and technologies.

      - title: Erika’s Work
        description: Erika studies the politics of medical knowledge under the mentorship of Dr. Thomas Reifer in the Sociology Department at the University of San Diego. Using comparative-historical and world-systems analysis, she investigates how modernity split intellectual life into the sciences and humanities and how this divide hampers efforts to address issues of health inequity. The Hippocratic Oath would seem to challenge this proposed divide with respect to medicine, but remains understudied. Despite spending some $4.5 trillion on healthcare, the U.S. ranks among the lowest in outcomes compared to other advanced capitalist countries. Erika’s work raises pertinent questions regarding the Oath’s role, if any, in guiding medical inquiry and practice to aim for thriving communities and economies. Relying on Weber’s analysis of rationalization, she argues that Western medicine prioritizes means-end rational action and avoids the question of substantive rational action.

    title: Founding story
    content: >
      The STS-I was founded by Erika Atienza, a fifth-year undergraduate student at the University of San Diego, and her partner, Léo Ambrogelly, an undergraduate student at Pomona College. At USD, they observed the contagious changemaking attitudes and its deep commitment to research rooted in the liberal arts experience. They sought to further contribute to USD’s outlined missions by launching the STS-I to foster intellectual inquiry in a world that increasingly separates STEM from the humanities and social sciences.

    title: Frequently asked questions
    questions:
      - title: "What is Science and Technology Studies (STS)?"
        description: We will begin by defining each term independently before we understand their relationship to each other and STS. Science is a systematic discipline built to understand the natural world; technology is an approach to manipulating and engaging with the natural world, often with the aim of troubleshooting; and society refers to people(s) that seek to understand and engage with the natural world, typically to address problems ordered by personal, political, and social priorities. The interactions between these three subjects are a function of space, time, and global public affairs and thus, cannot be studied in isolation. The following was written with the support of <a href="https://youtu.be/_PxLNcIQQb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>, published by Alipio T. Garcia, a professor of Physics at the University of Philippines Baguio. We find it to be a helpful introduction to STS.
      - title: "Where did STS come from?"
        description: STS is a nascent discipline that emerged during the Cold War. The  most transformative works come from Thomas Kuhn–a formerly-trained physicist turned historian and philosopher–who in his seminal 1962 work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, contends that (1) scientific fields undergo “paradigm shifts” as opposed to a linear path toward universal truth and (2) our current understanding of what is factually true is a function of the dominant model of epistemology, determined by scientists, their priorities (as well as society’s), and the existing tools they had access to measure their observations.
      - title: "How is our planned curriculum different from something like Biomedical Ethics?"
        description: Great question! While USD currently offers a Biomedical Ethics (BME) minor, our focus is distinct. BME primarily addresses moral and ethical dilemmas in medicine and biology, while STS seeks to include other disciplines such as astronomy, physics, engineering. The goal of STS is to probe the cultural, social, and historical contexts of all disciplines under the broad umbrella of STEM knowledge. This initiative places emphasis on understanding the history of the sciences and technologies, an area we have noticed is underrepresented in USD's BME curriculum. 
      - title: "What topics do STS scholars explore?"
        description: For natural scientists interested in the biological sciences, examples include the history of medicine, the social dimension of gene-editing, the politics of medicine and healthcare provision, and much more! Physicists, like Dr. Thomas Kuhn, the father of STS, have studied shfits in how we understand motion. STS scholars are also leading experts in the 'science of science,' understanding and mitigating inequalities or methodological issues across fields.
      - title: "Why is STS important?"
        description: The more we learn about our fundamentally complicated reality, the more we realize there is much more to uncover. In response, we build tools to analyze the world from new perspectives. We built the microscope to observe bacterial growth, only to learn we need another tool to observe structures at the atomic level. These very tools, paradoxically, have been used to both heal and harm ourselves. Science and technology evidently dominate our lives; we rely on them and are regularly confronted by their influences. Many of their applications are and have been hotly contested. Many scientists and technologists—let alone laypeople and our governmental representatives—are not fully informed about the historical and contemporary implications of these fields. Policy determines their accessibility and uses. It is our duty to be well-informed contributing members of society, capable of assessing the extent to which the knowledge produced and reinforced is fully addressed. This mission is achievable through the scholarship of an STS program.
